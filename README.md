# Fresh-Ideas

Hello. This project is the test task, thanks for it EXTRUMS.

Problems and myself weaknesses which i met:

1) First and more important - problems with fetch request and API. The main problem was absent SSL certificate boreadapi.com, what make request impossible(in my opinion). I decided to try to get main data from other source. This resource is the Git repository of boredapi. I got a list of "activities" from API request. For use received JSON data, i had to make some actions for decoding data from "Base64" and make string valid for parse to object.

2) I have to improve my knowledge of CSS. My weaknesses of CSS are: 
- work and understanding "z-index" property; 
- CSS animations, on current moment my skills of animation is too bad and primitive.


Technologies which i used:
- HTML5;
- SVG;
- CSS3;
- mediaqueries;
- keyframes;
- SCSS;
- GULP;
- JavaScript;
- Fetch;
- API.
